# AzureDataFactory(ADF)-Concepts–IntegrationRuntime-LinkedService-Dataset-Real-Time-Interview-Cheat-Sheet.md
This is a **detailed guide** to help you answer real-time ADF interview questions with **conceptual understanding**, **short answers**, and **analogies**.  

---

## 1️⃣ What is Integration Runtime (IR)?

**Detailed Explanation:**  
- IR is the **compute infrastructure** that moves data between source and destination.  
- Types:  
  1. **Azure IR** – cloud-to-cloud copy/transform  
  2. **Self-hosted IR** – on-premises data access  
  3. **Azure-SSIS IR** – runs SSIS packages in cloud  
- Handles **data movement, activity dispatching, and secure communication**.

**Analogy:**  
- IR = **bridge or road** connecting home (cloud) to market (on-prem).  

**Short Answer:**  
> “IR is the bridge/path that allows ADF to connect on-prem or cloud sources and move data securely.”

## 2️⃣ What is a Linked Service?

**Detailed Explanation:**  
- Linked Service is a **connection configuration** to a data source/destination.  
- Contains **connection string, credentials, and authentication**.  
- Required for **any source or sink in ADF**.

**Analogy:**  
- Linked Service = **vehicle** carrying water or fruits from market to home.  

**Short Answer:**  
> “A Linked Service is a connection to a data source or destination, like a vehicle transporting the data.”

---

## 3️⃣ What is a Dataset?

**Detailed Explanation:**  
- Dataset defines the **structure and location of the data**.  
- Tells ADF **what to read/write**, e.g., CSV, Parquet, SQL table.  
- Each dataset is **specific to a data type or structure**.

**Analogy:**  
- Dataset = **container** like a water bottle or fruit bag.

**Short Answer:**  
> “A Dataset represents the structure of data, like a container used to hold the data.”

---

## 4️⃣ How many IR, Linked Services, and Datasets are required?

**Detailed Explanation:**  
- **IR:** Shared if source/destination same.  
- **Linked Service:** One per source/destination.  
- **Dataset:** One per data structure/type.  

**Example:**  
- MySQL + SFTP sources → IR:1, Linked Services:2, Datasets:2  

**Short Answer:**  
> “IR can be shared across multiple sources if location is same; Linked Services and Datasets are source-specific.”

## 5️⃣ Difference between Self-hosted IR and Azure IR

| Feature          | Self-hosted IR                     | Azure IR                     |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Location         | On-premises                        | Cloud                        |
| Purpose          | Access local/on-prem sources       | Cloud-to-cloud data movement |
| Maintenance      | User-managed                       | Fully managed by Azure       |
| Security         | Private network access             | Cloud-secure only            |

**Short Answer:**  
> “Self-hosted IR is installed on-prem to access local data; Azure IR runs in the cloud for cloud-to-cloud data movement.”

---

## 6️⃣ Can one IR be used for multiple datasets?

**Detailed Explanation:**  
- Yes, as long as **source and destination are reachable** by that IR.  
- Reduces cost and management overhead.  

**Analogy:**  
- One bridge can carry **water bottles and fruit bags** simultaneously.  

**Short Answer:**  
> “Yes, as long as the IR connects the same source and destination.”

## 7️⃣ How to move data from SFTP to ADLS?

**Detailed Steps:**  
1. Create **Linked Service** for SFTP.  
2. Create **Linked Service** for ADLS.  
3. Define **Datasets** for source and destination.  
4. Use **Copy Activity** in a pipeline.  
5. Assign **IR** (Self-hosted if SFTP on-prem, Azure IR if cloud).  
6. Trigger pipeline manually or via schedule.

**Short Answer:**  
> “Create Linked Services for SFTP and ADLS, define Datasets, then use a Copy Activity via an IR.”
